The run_analysis.R script allows to analyse the content of two samples of measures from the Human Activity Recognition Smartphone Dataset. The two samples, test and train, include observations of different subjects included either in a test either in a train group. 
Firstly the different columns are labelled according to the appropriate feature name. Then, the two datasets made available are merged in a unique dataset. Given that each row includes feature measures for a specific subject during a specific activity, an extra column including the combination "Subject_Activity" is created. 
Then, only some columns of interest are isolated from the initial dataset, that are the ones including measures of the mean or the standard deviation. Using these columns a new dataset is obtained. In this the different observations (rows) are grouped according to different strata given by the combinations "Subject_Activity". Finally, using the dplyr package the mean for the values of each different feature is estimated within each different group. Those estimates are presented in the file final.txt 

The run_analysis.R script can be broken down in 5 main subsections 

A) the dataset set up
	This part includes all the steps necessary to load the data of interest from the different txt files

B) 1) the merge between the test and train dataset 4) the labelling of the different row and column variables
	In this section columns and rows are labelled taking from the the text files including Subjects and Activities identifiers, that are subject_test.txt and features.txt
	Then the train and the test dataset after having been labelled are merged using the rbind command.

C) 3) The different activities are properly labelled within the dataset

D) 2) The columns including measures related to mean or standard deviation are identified within the dataset and a new dataset is created

E) 5) Finally in the new dataset observations are grouped according to the related "Subject-Activity" group and the mean within each of those is estimated.
